Intuit moved workloads to the cloud for the usual reasons of cheaper processing and more flexibility and he's explaining his lessons learned.

- Workload choice requirements
  - build environments
  - load test generation
  - decoupled systems

- Choice of toolset
  - Hybrid was attractive, but went with cloud-native
  - Cloud vendor lockin was a risk, but they feel comfortable with the choice
